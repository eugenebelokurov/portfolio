					<p>Problem we solve:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>imagine having 100s items to sell e.g. vintage/preloved clothes, shoes or antiques. To sell your items faster, you want to be present on multiple marketplaces such as Ebay, Depop, Etsy, Vinted, or Shopify.</li>
							<li>managing items manually across all these platforms can be a daunting task and can limit your ability to scale your business. That's where our product comes in to automate the process of cross-listing and auto-delisting.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						Numbers: launched 3 years ago, hundreds of paying customers, 2,500,000+ listings made.

					<p>Provide users with more flexible sort functionality.</p>
					<h4>Why users needed a new sort</h4>
					<p>We were about to launch a new paid feature that would allow users to boost sales.</p>
					<p>To utilize this new feature users need to sort or filter their inventory by "listed at" date. The lack of a more powerful sort was a blocker.</p>

				<h2><span class="my-section">&lt;section&gt;</span> <span class="section-value">Researching sort in other products</span></h2>
				<p>The sort function is present in a lot of products already. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. That's why I focused on e-commerce and no-code software with database functionality. Also checked out Dribbble and Behance.</p>

				<h4>Outcomes of research</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Notion as the main inspiration.</b> Our product is data-heavy so I decided to use sort by Notion as a main source of inspiration.</li>
					<li><b>User-friendly wording.</b> One of the design principles suggests reducing the cognitive load of UIs. Using "New first" instead of "Ascending" does that.</li>
					<li><b>Immediate vs action-based sort.</b> Applying sort after clicking "Apply" is more user-friendly for cases with granular settings such as ours. It also implies fewer requests to our backend and was supported by our engineers later.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2><span class="my-section">&lt;section&gt;</span> <span class="section-value">Brainstorming with engineers</span></h2>
				<p>After research, I had a general idea for UI. But are there any potential roadblocks? I approached our engineering team with two questions in mind:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Is there anything I must consider engineering-wise when designing the feature?</li>
					<li>How to display all the dates without ruining the interface? I was stuck and needed help. See my initial idea below.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I wanted to provide users with feedback when sort is applied. But how to achieve it without cluttering the dashboard? At the moment, I couldn't come up with anything better than showing dates for all items and marketplaces.</p>
				<div class="cover-secondary">
					<h4>Important info isn't avaliable at a glance</h4>
					<div class="centered-img">
						<img src="sort-case/sort-as-it-is.png">
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4>Ideas after meeting with engineers:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>We don't store dates needed to sort by listing date. The data need to be imported before we launch the new sort.</li>
					<li>One of the engineers suggested a brilliant idea: allow to sort within only one marketplace hence we need to show dates only for one marketplace. I decided to proceed with this solution.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="s4-gap">
				<h2><span class="my-section">&lt;section&gt;</span> <span class="section-value">We have to launch in stages</span></h2>
				<p>The rolling-out process wasn't smooth because of the tight timeline and constraints on the engineering side. Importing data for millions of items would be extremely resource-demanding so we decided to rollout the new sort for paid subscribers first. Stages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>added sort for Ebay for paid subscribers only;</li>
					<li>added sort for Ebay for all users;</li>
					<li>added sort for Depop for paid subscribers only;</li>
					<li>added sort for Depop for all users.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I provided users with a tooltip explaining our future plans and current limitations.</p>

				<h2><span class="my-section">&lt;section&gt;</span> <span class="section-value">Key takeways</span></h2>
				<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Speak with engineers as soon as possible.</b> [1] A great UI idea came from an engineer. Benefits of working as a team. [2] We didn't have all the required data so I had to adjust my design. No way I knew that if I was working separately from the rest of the team.</li>
					<li><b>Some problems are already solved.</b> There was no need to craft search functionality from scratch. It is well-known piece of an interface. Adapting existing solutions worked perfectly for us.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Next steps</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Allow to combine sorts</li>
					<li>Import dates for the rest of marketplaces</li>
					<li>Update filter functionality</li>
				</ul>
