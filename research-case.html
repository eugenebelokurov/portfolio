			<h1>User research in my work</h1>
			<h2>Product</h2>
			<p>
				Software for professional resellers in the UK.
			</p>
			<p>
				Problem we solve: imagine having 100s items to sell e.g. vintage/preloved clothes, shoes or antiques. To sell your items faster, you want to be present on multiple marketplaces such as Ebay, Depop, Etsy, Vinted, or Shopify. However, managing items manually across all these platforms can be a daunting task and can limit your ability to scale your business. That's where our product comes in to automate the process of cross-listing and auto-delisting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Numbers: launched 3 years ago, hundreds of paying customers, 2,500,000+ listings made.
			</p>
			<h2>Task</h2>
			<p>
				Help UK resellers get more sales.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a way to get more sales on Ebay and Depop: delete and list again stagnant items. The items you sell must be fresh. I was assigned to design from scratch and launch the feature.
			</p>
			<h2>Research</h2>
			<h3>Quantitative research</h3>
			<p>Launched an email campaign with a questionnaire to confirm if the problem is really there {↓}</p>
			<div class="ui-image">
				<img src="research-case-cover-quant-one.png" alt="Quant research 1">

			<p>Received and processed 25 responses from users {↓}</p>

			</div>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
			<p>
				problem confirmed: resellers follow the workflow but do it outside our software
			</p>
			<p>
				new findings:
				[i] users end items based on how old items are
				[ii] some users want to end items on one marketplace only, some want to do it on multiple platforms in one go
			</p>
			<h3>User interviews</h3>
			<p>
				Created 3 interactive prototypes to test potential solutions.
				Conducted 5 user interviews to choose the best option. Users were given a task and I silently observed if they face any struggles {↓}
			</p>
			<div class="ui-image">
				<img src="research-case-cover-user-interview.png" alt="Look at this boy!">
			</div>
			<p>
				Conclusion
				The simplest version won: the one with less clicks and allowing to work with one marketplace at a time
			</p>
			<h2>Discussing outcomes with the team</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>[i] Engineering team lead: we had a tight timeline and limited resources. I wanted to make sure that the solutions I came up with are feasible</li>
				<li>[ii] Founder of the company: I aligned with the founder to make sure the solution is compliant with company’s strategy</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Final changes and handoff to developers</h2>
			<p>I refined the final version and prepared the task description for engineers. I usually use the following structure</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Context</li>
				<li>How users face FEATURE</li>
				<li>What should happen when users interact with FEATURE</li>
				<li>How does it influence the product</li>
				<li>link to interactive prototype in Figma</li>
			</ul>
